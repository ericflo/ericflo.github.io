<div class="entry-content"><p>In the moments leading up to my DjangoCon keynote this year (called
<a class="reference external" href="http://djangocon.blip.tv/file/4112452/">Why Django Sucks, and How We Can Fix It</a>), I pictured the room an hour in the
future and imagined what things would be like.  I envisioned all kinds of
scenarios: one where people were literally booing, or another where I needed to
sneak back to my hotel room to avoid embarassment.  I imagined all of these
scenarios because I was about to level some harsh criticism at a technology
that everyone in the room was enthusiastic about.</p>
<p>And then I went on stage and gave the talk.</p>
<p>When it was finished, I braced myself for one of these scenarios to unfold.
Instead, what happened in the following moments, the following days, and indeed
the following month since then has been what I consider to be the most gracious
and useful response to criticism that I&#8217;ve ever seen.  And I think it deserves
to be highlighted, because I believe that reacting well to criticism is vital
for any successful community.</p>
<p>So what happened in the moments directly following the talk?
<a class="reference external" href="http://cecinestpasun.com/">Russell Keith-Magee</a>, arguably the most active core developer at the time,
made a special point to march up to the front of the stage and publicly shake
my hand. This gesture not only legitimized some of the things that I said (some
of which were quite extreme), but it also set the tone for the discourse around
my talk; civility.</p>
<p>Afterwards, privately, I apologized to several of the Django core developers.
These are people I respect and admire, and I wanted to make sure that they knew
that, at least on my end, it wasn&#8217;t personal.  I was expecting forgiveness, but
instead I received thanks.  Thanking me for criticising their project?  Not
what I was expecting.</p>
<p>One of the things that I suggested was to make <a class="reference external" href="http://alexgaynor.net/">Alex Gaynor</a> a core developer.
A few people at the conference made comments wondering how many days it would
take before that would happen.  Days went by, and the conference ended without
this happening.  A week went by.  A few more.  But I knew better, because the
Django core committers don&#8217;t do anything brashly.  They took their time, let
all dust and emotions settle down, and listened to the discussion.</p>
<p>And then <a class="reference external" href="http://jacobian.org/">Jacob Kaplan-Moss</a> issued <a class="reference external" href="http://groups.google.com/group/django-developers/browse_thread/thread/9ebc3e57d539d1ff">an official announcement</a>.  I
particularly agreed with one of the <a class="reference external" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1740675">top comments on hackernews</a>:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&quot;I don't know enough about the specifics of the case to
assess the new policy on the merits, but I will say that
as a piece of writing this is a model of how to change
policy gracefully: clear, forthright, and non-defensive.&quot;
</pre>
<p>Clear.  Forthright.  Non-defensive.</p>
<p>Some people saw this as an opening to change even more about Django, and even
when some of the discussion was phrased rudely or accusatory, the Django team&#8217;s
responses were thoughtful and calm.  Now, over a week later (again
demonstrating that things aren&#8217;t done brashly), we see that a half-dozen new
people have been added to the core team.  Yes, that includes <a class="reference external" href="http://alexgaynor.net/">Alex Gaynor</a>.
So not only was the new policy clear, forthright, and non-defensive, but there
was concrete follow-through so that everyone can see that it wasn&#8217;t just words.</p>
<p>And even in that short time since the new committers were added, Django&#8217;s code
is already reaping the benefits&#8211;we&#8217;ve seen a flurry of bugs fixed and tickets
closed.  Django&#8217;s future has never looked so promising!</p>
<p>Why do I think this is so important?  Because a community which welcomes
constructive criticism is one in which people feel they can make a difference.
And it&#8217;s because they <em>can</em> make a difference.  It&#8217;s a community that&#8217;s never
satisfied with the status quo.  It&#8217;s a community that can grow and change and
adapt, when the world around it changes.  It&#8217;s a community that we can be proud
of.</p>
<p>NB: I was not the only one to criticize Django at DjangoCon.  I was merely one
voice.  This is just written from my perspective.</p></div>
