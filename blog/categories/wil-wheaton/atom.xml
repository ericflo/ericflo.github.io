There has been a somewhat minor update to the site.  Now almost all of the site is cached.  That is, there is a memcached_ backend running on the server, and this website can take advantage of that.</p>

<p>To test out the site's load capabilities, I used an open source program called OpenWebLoad_.  It's quite impressive in its simplicity and utility.  With it, I was able to test a load of over 50 simultaneous users to the website.  Surprisingly, the site handled it with flying colors.</p>

<p>On a side note, I went to <code>Wil Wheaton's site</code>_ after a long stint of not visiting it, and it's still as good as it's ever been.  There's an almost tangible difference between a writer's website and a blogger's website.  I think that it boils down to the fact that using only words, Wil can make you feel the emotion that he wants you to feel.</p>
