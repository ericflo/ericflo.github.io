    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
Over the past week, I've had several people write me asking how I prefer to do syntax highlighting.  It's funny that this question cropped up now, just as I changed the way that it's handled on this blog.  The way that I used to do it was what I <code>posted to djangosnippets</code>_ almost a year ago: use a regular expression to parse out <code>&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;</code> blocks, highlight the stuff in-between, and spit it back out.</p>

<p>The problem with that method was that that would require some more sophisticated logic now that I'm using RestructuredText<em> to write all of my posts.  Unwilling to think any harder than necessary, I did a quick <code>google search</code></em>, and the second result was exactly what I was looking for: a RestructuredText directive<em>, ready-made by the Pygments</em> people.</p>

<p>The trick is to put <code>this file</code><em> somewhere on your python path.  Then, in the <code>__init__.py</code> of one of the Django apps that will use syntax highlighting, just import the file.  It's <strong>that simple</strong>!  (I love RestructuredText.)  But it's not only RestructuredText that benefits from this style of plugin.  Markdown</em>, too, has a <code>similar plugin</code>_--again provided by the Pygments people.</p>

<p>.. code-block:: restructuredtext</p>

<pre><code>.. code-block:: python

    print "This is an example of how to use RestructuredText's new directive."
</code></pre>

<p>I hope that this answers some of the questions that people had.  On a similar note, I'm extremely happy to see that people have been finding the <code>Contact Me</code>_ link on the right side of the page.  Please continue to send me any questions and comments that you have for me!</p>
