  <div class="entry-content"><p><a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/django-threadedcomments/">Django-threadedcomments</a> is a simple yet flexible threaded commenting system for Django.  What I mean when I say threaded is that commenters can reply not only to the original item, but to other comments as well.  It is very similar to what Reddit or Digg have in their comments sections.</p>
<p>The idea for this application started about a month and a half ago, when my good friend Tony Hauber asked if I would work with him on a project idea that he had (more info on this in the future).  One of the major components of the project would need to be threaded comments.  Naturally, the first thing that I did was attempt to make <tt class="docutils literal">django.contrib.comments</tt> work for this purpose.  In the end, however, I kept running into problems which all basically boiled down to the fact that <tt class="docutils literal">django.contrib.comments</tt> was never meant for this purpose.</p>
<p>So I used <tt class="docutils literal">django.contrib.comments</tt> as a starting point, brought in some of the best features of the excellent <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/django-comment-utils/">django-comment-utils</a> (In fact, <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/django-threadedcomments/">django-threadedcomments</a> actually provides a fair amount of compatiblity with the Managers from django-comment-utils), and added a bit of my own alchemy.  This is the result of those things.</p>
<p>A lot of effort has gone into documentation on this project: inline documentation, <a class="reference external" href="http://api.rst2a.com/1.0/rst2/html?uri=http%3A//django-threadedcomments.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/tutorial.txt&amp;style=zope">a tutorial on setting it up with a blog</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="http://api.rst2a.com/1.0/rst2/html?uri=http%3A//django-threadedcomments.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api.txt&amp;style=zope">complete API documentation</a>.  In fact, to see what you&#8217;ll get after completing <a class="reference external" href="http://api.rst2a.com/1.0/rst2/html?uri=http%3A//django-threadedcomments.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/tutorial.txt&amp;style=zope">the tutorial</a>, head on over to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.eflorenzano.com/threadedcomments/example/">this page</a>.  Please excuse my color scheme there&#8211;It&#8217;s the comments that I&#8217;m trying to show off, not my design skills (or lack thereof).</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re worried about the hassle of writing a script to migrate all of your <tt class="docutils literal">django.contrib.comments</tt> comments to this new system, then fear not: there&#8217;s an included migration script and you&#8217;ll only need to run <tt class="docutils literal">python manage.py migratecomments</tt> and the migration is automatically taken care of for you.</p>
<p>I really hope that this can be a useful tool for people looking to add a threaded commenting system to a project of theirs.  <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/django-threadedcomments/">Check it out</a> and see if it&#8217;s right for you!</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just got back from the caucuses, and am happy to report that Obama took our precinct in a landslide.  It was an immensely interesting experience to be a part of this process and it really felt like I was doing something important&#8211;because I was.  What was most interesting was that a small group of dedicated Obama supporters conscientiously defected to go support Biden, because the Biden supporters pledged to support Edwards if Biden was not deemed viable.  This meant that Obama lost no delegates, but that Edwards lost one delegate.</p>
<p>It was also great to see celebrities get involved too.  I was sitting about 4 feet away from Scarlett Johansson before the caucus when she was calling people to support Obama.  Didn&#8217;t know she was going to be there and then looked over to my right and there she was!  I&#8217;ve also heard that Kal Penn was very involved, as my friend got a call from him directly.</p>
<p>Our final precinct results were:
Obama: 5 delegates
Clinton: 2 delegates
Edwards: 1 delegate
Biden: 1 delegate</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Widgets are everywhere!  It seems that every blog these days has at least a couple of widgets on their sidebar.  Yesterday I realized that I had never written one, and probably more importantly, I really had no concrete idea how they worked.  Using Django and a bit of Javascript, it turned out to be quite easy!  I&#8217;m going to show you the basics of how to write a widget yourself, but if enough people would like the source code to mine, I&#8217;ll happily open source it.</p>
<p>Before starting on creating a widget, we&#8217;ve got to make sure that it has an API of some sort.  In the case of Pownce, there some <a class="reference external" href="http://pownce.pbwiki.com/API+Documentation1-1">Community Documentation</a> about the various things that can be done with its API.  For a simple widget, all we really need is to be able to <a class="reference external" href="http://pownce.pbwiki.com/API+Documentation1-1#PublicNoteList">fetch some public notes.</a></p>
<p>Our API call will be: <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">http://api.pownce.com/1.1/public_note_lists.json</span></tt></p>
<p>Now that we&#8217;ve determined where to get our data, let&#8217;s parse it and do something with it.</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure><p>Now you may be noticing that I&#8217;m not using the simpler <tt class="docutils literal">django.shortcuts.render_to_response</tt>.  That&#8217;s because we&#8217;re going to use the content that we&#8217;ve rendered here as context for another template which we&#8217;ll use in a moment.  Also note that if you were to do this in a production environment, using a simple urlopen is not considered good practice.  See <a class="reference external" href="http://www.diveintopython.org/http_web_services/review.html">chapter 11</a> in <a class="reference external" href="http://diveintomark.org/">Mark Pilgrim&#8217;s</a> excellent <a class="reference external" href="http://www.diveintopython.org/toc/index.html">Dive Into Python</a> for more information about what to do instead.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s create a template:</p>
<figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

</span><span class="line"><span class="nt">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure><p>What we&#8217;ve done here is iterated over the public notes, and simply created an unordered list with the first 30 or less words from the note.  Also, we&#8217;ve provided a link to Pownce for each note listed.</p>
<p>If browsers could make cross-domain requests, we&#8217;d be done now: you could embed a small Javascript file which would asynchronously request this page and update the DOM accordingly.  However, this is not possible, so I&#8217;ve come up with a way to do it instead.  I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s a best practice&#8211;it sure seems to me like it&#8217;s not&#8211;but it works, which is probably more important anyway.</p>

There are lots of customization options from here: GET arguments, different API endpoints, etc.  Not only that, but there&#8217;s lots of room for visual customization using CSS.  What we&#8217;re doing is effectively generating Javascript, so anything that you&#8217;d like to do using Javascript is fair game as well.</p>
<p>The result after tweaking for a bit is what you see at the right under my &quot;Widgets&quot; links.  Here is a picture in case it stops working for some reason:</p>

<p>If you&#8217;d like to create a pownce widget of your own by simply adding a snippet to your site, I&#8217;ve provided a <a class="reference external" href="http://media.eflorenzano.com/static/powncecreate.html">Pownce Widget Creator</a> for your convenience.</p>
<p>I think that it was fairly easy to do this using Django and Python, and if you&#8217;ve got any tips on best practices, please let me know so that I can code a better widget!</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was lucky enough to be able to attend PyCon last year, and hope to do so again, but some great resources are starting to show up online for those who couldn&#8217;t.  One example is Jacob Kaplan-Moss&#8217;s talk named <a class="reference external" href="http://advocacy.python.org/podcasts/pycon/PyCon2007-BecomingOSDeveloper.mp3">Becoming an Open Source Developer: Lessons from the Django Project</a>.</p>
<p>Even if you&#8217;ve read James Bennett&#8217;s <a class="reference external" href="http://www.b-list.org/weblog/2007/feb/23/pycon-2007-web-frameworks-panel/">excellent writeup</a> from the conference, some <a class="reference external" href="http://advocacy.python.org/podcasts/pycon/PyCon2007-WebFrameworksPanel.mp3">audio from the event itself</a> can always be fun to listen to.  Right now that&#8217;s all I could find, but there&#8217;s new audio showing up from PyCon every week.  The only way to stay updated is to subscribe to the <a class="reference external" href="http://advocacy.python.org/podcasts/pycon2007.rss">PyCon 2007 Podcast RSS Feed</a>.</p>

<dt><a class="reference external" href="http://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/NewformsAdminBranch">Newforms-Admin</a></dt>
<dd><p class="first">Started soon after the newforms package started to become stable, the newforms-admin branch
allows for a much more modular and flexible admin application.  The amount of flexibility allowed in
this branch extends to permissions, allowing for user-defined permissions schemes&#8211;can you say
&#8216;row-level permissions&#8217;?  It&#8217;s even flexible enough to require no permissions at all: I needed a quick
display interface for work this past summer, and I used some of the hooks in the newforms-admin
branch to disable login and permissions and simply display some data publicly.</p>
<p class="last">Also, multiple different admin interfaces are easy with newforms-admin.  Group your apps into
functional sets and give each functional set its own admin interface.  Those who are using this
branch know that once you&#8217;ve gone newforms-admin, you&#8217;ll never go back!</p>

<dd><p class="first last">This one flew under my radar until very recently.  Their stated goal is &quot;to make it as easy as
possible to build GIS web applications and harness the power of spatially enabled data.&quot;  These guys
have done some really amazing things with this branch, including linking of the geographic data to
cool widgets that can be displayed in the admin interface (think google maps, openlayers, and more
to come as time goes on).  I don&#8217;t personally have a need for any of the capabilities being added in
this project, but the scope and quality of what is being produced is impressive to say the least.</p>

<dd><p class="first last">As code grows and evolves, it&#8217;s difficult to stop at a certain point and say, &quot;this code doesn&#8217;t fit the
bill anymore.&quot;  <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pointy-stick.com/blog/">Malcolm Tredinnick</a> was the one who stopped and said it.  Already at this stage,
<a class="reference external" href="http://code.djangoproject.com/query?status=new&amp;status=assigned&amp;status=reopened&amp;keywords=%7Eqs-rf&amp;order=priority">many many bugs</a> have been fixed by this branch.  Queryset-refactoring is not just for fixing
bugs.  Once it&#8217;s completed, database backends will have a much easier time of customizing their
generated SQL.  With each change like this, Django becomes more modular.</p>

<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt><a class="reference external" href="http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/6095">Manually-Specified Intermediary Model Support</a></dt>
<dd><p class="first last">OK I&#8217;m biased on this one.  This is the patch that I&#8217;ve been working on lately.  It&#8217;s because every
time I create an Django application, I start out with a ManyToManyField and end up breaking that off
into a separate model.  Once that&#8217;s done, I have to change all of my code so that it doesn&#8217;t use the
convenient ManyToManyField helpers.  Once this patch is complete, you&#8217;ll be able to specify an
intermediary model which will act as the storage for your m2m data.  In this way, extra information
can be attached to each relationship.</p>

<dd><p class="first last">We&#8217;re entering into 2008 soon, and that will mean that Django has been public for over two years.
Some of the core developers have been using it internally for even longer than that.  So one of the
things which people have started running into, is that app_labels have started clashing.  There hasn&#8217;t
been any definitive decision on how to avoid these clashes, but there have been several promising
proposals.  In any case, expect this functionality to change somewhat in the next few months, so
that &#8216;ellington.search&#8217; can coexist alongside &#8216;chicagocrime.search&#8217;.  No longer will you have to worry
about naming everything differently!</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These are just a few of the developments that are going on which seem interesting and promising.  I hope that each and every one of these developing features eventually makes it into trunk, so that everyone can benefit from the hard work that people have put into the project.  Also, if you&#8217;ve got a feature that you&#8217;re excited about, let me know through the comments.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Getting involved in an open source project is hard.  I&#8217;ve been working with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.djangoproject.com">Django</a> since early 2006 and doing so makes me want to contribute back to the project.  Several times now I&#8217;ve made attempts to do so, but all of them have failed.  Looking back it&#8217;s easy to see where I, as a newcomer to the open source world, went wrong.  So let&#8217;s start out with what <strong>not</strong> to do, by example.  After that I&#8217;ll give some suggestions on what I think is the right way to go about it.</p>
<div class="section" id="don-t-do-these-things">
<h2>Don&#8217;t do these things:</h2>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>Don&#8217;t bite off more than you can chew</dt>
<dd><p class="first last">As a newcomer to both Python and Django, and to web development in general, one thing that I
constantly needed to do was redefine my models slightly differently as I discovered flaws in my
previous designs.  Django does not make this easy, as you either have to manually migrate your
SQL or you have to delete all of your data.  Can you see where this is going?  I thought, &quot;Perfect,
there&#8217;s a way that I can contribute!  I&#8217;ll add schema evolution to Django!&quot;  This was a huge
undertaking, it took a long time, and it eventually flopped because I simply didn&#8217;t have the
experience at that point necessary to accomplish this task.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>Don&#8217;t work privately</dt>
<dd><p class="first last">The other problem with tackling schema evolution was that I had contacted off-list another person
who was enthusiastic about the idea, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.crankycoder.com/">Victor NG</a>.  Now  he&#8217;s a great coder and did a lot of the
work on that project, but he wasn&#8217;t an established member of the community.  We had set up a
completely separate SVN (actually <a class="reference external" href="http://svk.bestpractical.com/view/HomePage">SVK</a>) server and everything.  The result was that we were
completely shut off from the rest of the development community, and didn&#8217;t get any input or insight
from the people who were really running the project.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>As a newcomer, don&#8217;t work on a community project</dt>
<dd><p class="first last">The next thing that I tried working on was a &quot;DjangoForge&quot; project.  I worked very hard for almost a
month&#8211;the month leading up to PyCon&#8211;and got a complete prototype up and running.  When I got
to PyCon, I expected to make a big debut and everyone would instantly love it and jump on board.
Wow, was that naive!  Nobody knew who I was, and everyone had different ideas about what a
community portal, a &quot;DjangoForge&quot;, would need to be.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="do-these-things">
<h2>Do these things:</h2>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>Start without code</dt>
<dd><p class="first last">Start on documentation.  There are two reasons that this is a good idea.  Firstly, those people who
are checking in tickets will start to recognize your name and will see that you&#8217;re interested in
contributing.  Secondly, you will begin to understand more and more about the internals of the
framework as you see how people are adding features.  I think that writing documentation is boring,
but what&#8217;s more boring is not knowing the codebase well enough and writing bad code as a result.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>Then do test code</dt>
<dd><p class="first last">After documenting some of the underpinnings of the framework, you now have a pretty good idea
about how it <em>should</em> behave.  Now make sure it really behaves that way.  Many people don&#8217;t follow
the <a class="reference external" href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?CodeUnitTestFirst">Code Unit Test First</a> or test-driven development methodology.  That is, they write the code
and submit the patch without formal tests.  These patches usually can&#8217;t be checked in to Django
without test code, as a lot of people rely on the trunk to be stable.  So you can do a lot of good by
simply writing test code, and it will earn you a lot of gratitude from the folks trying to get things
done.  On top of being helpful and earning gratitude, it helps you to learn the framework that much
better.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>Work on already-submitted tickets.</dt>
<dd><p class="first last">It can be tempting to work on a pet-feature that you would like to have done.  This is not a bad
temptation, but for someone who is trying to become part of the community, it may be better to look
at what the core developers are anxious to have done.  This is where I am currently, working on
<a class="reference external" href="http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/6095">tickets</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/6064">that the</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/6066">core devs</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/6092">have filed</a>.  They have good reasons for filing these tickets:
they have deemed it a wanted feature or bug, they have determined that it&#8217;s a solvable idea or
problem, and they may even have insights in how to implement it!  These tickets can range from
small-scale to large-scale and now is when you can really start to show your stuff as a programmer.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>Read django-dev mailing list</dt>
<dd><p class="first last">There&#8217;s nothing more helpful than tracking where Django is going and what ideas are being kicked
around on that list.  Many times an idea has been brought up, fleshed out, and eventually decided
upon.  This doesn&#8217;t always happen in the ticket tracker, and it shouldn&#8217;t.  Whenever discussion is
needed, the mailing lists are a much better forum for that discussion to take place.  This is also a
good place to ping the community on tickets that you&#8217;re interested in or have worked on.  Just
<em>please</em> don&#8217;t spam the list, as nothing will make people more upset at you than a whiny spammer
on the django-dev mailing list.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="and-beyond">
<h2>&#8230;and beyond</h2>
<p>After that, I have no more solid advice.  That&#8217;s where I&#8217;m sitting right now with the Django project.  I&#8217;d like to become even more involved.  I&#8217;ll probably will go about doing so by starting to propose new features, jumping in on the conversation, attending PyCon 2008, and working on spinoff projects like the excellent <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/django-evolution/">django-evolution</a>.  But I&#8217;d like to know how other people have done it.  <strong>How have you gotten involved in the Django project?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a class="reference external" href="http://www.holovaty.com/">Adrian Holovaty</a> makes a great point in mentioning to check out the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/contributing/">Contributing to Django</a> section of the Django documentation, with gives a plethora of guidelines and tips for doing just that.  Thanks, Adrian!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve just relaunched the redesign of this site.  Nothing major is different, but one fun thing that I&#8217;d like to highlight is the way the blogroll is displayed.  I got the idea from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.moteldemoka.com/">Motel de Moka</a>, which has more links to work with than I do.</p>
<p>First, I set up a very simple model:</p>

So we must modify our model to have an integer called <tt class="docutils literal">name_size</tt>, and then override <tt class="docutils literal">BlogRollLink</tt>&#8217;s save function to fill in that field any time the model is saved.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today marked the last day of my internship at Eyespot.  There was such an outpouring of good will that it made me want to quit school immediately and stay with Eyespot.</p>
<p>I could not have asked for a better experience!</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all for today.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a class="reference external" href="http://groups.google.com/group/django-developers/browse_thread/thread/37801d8c2f46a313/a002ad9645e64e0a#a002ad9645e64e0a">Very interesting discussion</a> going on right now about Django&#8217;s templating language and whether to split it off into its own separate library.  One of the justifications is that it will &quot;feel&quot; easier to plug in other template languages into Django itself.  Funny how <a class="reference external" href="http://www.eflorenzano.com/blog/cheetah-and-django/">I just blogged about how easy this is already</a>.</p>
<p>Also, previously this site was run with apache2 and perlbal.  Now it&#8217;s running apache2 and nginx.  At some point I&#8217;m going to make the switch to having all of the media pointing to an nginx-only server which short circuits the mod_python (also soon to be mod_wsgi, lol) handlers altogether.</p>
<p>Sorry that this is another in a line of short posts, but I expect this trend will continue as I move twice in the next 2 weeks.  Crazy stuff happening in my life right now!</p></div>
