  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been using Python for a few years now, and continue to love it.  But the language is large enough that it seems every project that I look at uses a different subset of the language&#8217;s features.  The nice thing is that by reading different people&#8217;s code, you can find out about some real gems in the Python programming language.  Some of these tips are extremely obvious, and some are more obscure.  In any case, here are what I consider to be some real gems:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first"><a class="reference external" href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html?highlight=filter#filter">filter</a>  This is one of Python&#8217;s built-in functions, which allows you to remove unwanted items from a list.  It&#8217;s very useful and highly overlooked.  Here&#8217;s an example of how to use it:</p>
<figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

The answer: I didn&#8217;t know about it.  It&#8217;s not something you run into every day, but when you need it, it&#8217;s super useful.  Here&#8217;s an example:</p>
<figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="pycon"><span class="line"><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">s</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&#39;the little green men&#39;</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">s</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">title</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="go">&#39;The Little Green Men&#39;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure><p>It&#8217;s that easy!  Next time you need to turn something into a title, look for this method on strings first.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That&#8217;s all I&#8217;ve got for now.  There are many more gems in the Python programming language, but these are some that I think are especially useful.  Please share in the comments if you have any other gems that you have found in your uses of Python.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Eric Holscher has posted <a class="reference external" href="http://ericholscher.com/blog/2008/nov/3/python-gems-my-own/">a list of his Python gems as well</a>, and it&#8217;s got some great stuff on it.  Check it out!</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few days ago, someone asked me &quot;What&#8217;s the next big thing?&quot;  The context was a discussion of web development tools, as they exist today.  At first I laughed and brushed off the question as clichA, because everyone seems to have a different answer and almost nobody ends up being correct.  But it is a good question to ask oneself, and I&#8217;m noticing that more and more people seem to be searching for that &quot;next big thing&quot;.</p>
<p>The standard response du jour seems to be &quot;cloud computing&quot;.  However with a term like that, you can understand why there are disagreements as to what exactly cloud computing is.  I&#8217;m not so convinced.  I&#8217;m not convinced that thick client computing will come back, either, but certainly the thought of distributed computing will continue to resurface&#8211;which is quite directly at odds with the concept of cloud computing (depending on how you define cloud computing, of course).</p>
<div class="section" id="examining-today-s-problems">
<h2>Examining today&#8217;s problems</h2>
<p>Before we can talk about what will emerge as the next big thing, we need to first look at what sucks right now:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><strong>Concurrency.</strong>  Do I even need to spell out why this sucks right now?  It&#8217;s easy to get wrong, and anyone who thinks that it isn&#8217;t, is probably getting it wrong.</li>
<li><strong>Database technology, specifically relational databases.</strong>  This area of study is a proven and well-understood area of computer science, and for simple tasks, using a database could not get any easier.  Especially with the advance of <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping">object relational mappers</a> that are starting to generate really good SQL, it&#8217;s easier than ever to set up some data structures to store and retrieve data from a database.  Try to start scaling this solution, as <a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/">many</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://mahalo.com/">people</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://digg.com/">are</a>, and you&#8217;ll see why this technology (as it is today) doesn&#8217;t hold up.</li>
<li><strong>Push.</strong>  With the emergence of data whose value is highly time dilated (think <a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://friendfeed.com/">FriendFeed</a>, etc.), systems which operate under a &quot;pull&quot;-only interface are growing long in the tooth.  In fact, <a class="reference external" href="http://friendfeed.com/">FriendFeed</a> has a post explaining <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.friendfeed.com/2008/08/simple-update-protocol-fetch-updates.html">just how hard this is for them</a> (and proposing their own protocol which hasn&#8217;t seemed to get any traction).</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="those-next-big-things">
<h2>Those next big things</h2>
<p>Given the aforementioned problems facing developers today, is the outlook bleak?  Is there no hope for the future?  Of course not!  As always, there are some exciting new technologies that are addressing these very problems.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://erlang.org/">Erlang</a>.  People who hype it up will tell you that this magically solves all concurrency problems, and they are simply being overzealous.  That being said, erlang encourages a style of programming that is extremely conducive to writing highly scalable applications.  Not only that, but there are over 20 years worth of experience and effort that have gone into making this language rock solid.  We&#8217;ve seen, over the past few years, an uptake in the number of applications that are written in erlang.  I expect that trend to continue, and as our need for highly concurrent applications increases, that rate will increase as well.  It&#8217;s a good time to be an erlang programmer!</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://incubator.apache.org/couchdb/">CouchDB</a>.  This is a system which, from the ground up, was designed for scale.  Built upon the aforementioned Erlang programming language, and upon the well tested and trusted <a class="reference external" href="http://spawnlink.com/articles/introduction-to-the-open-telecom-platform/">OTP</a> methodology, CouchDB takes a completely new approach to databases.  It is a document-oriented database, which means that it&#8217;s best suited towards those documents which can easily be written down on a piece of paper.  (A business card is the prototypical example of a type of document that would be great to store in CouchDB.)  It&#8217;s a blog post unto itself, but the forward-looking nature of CouchDB, along with it&#8217;s adherence to the fundamentals of what makes the web work so well, has gotten a lot of people interested in the project.  I&#8217;d bet my career on CouchDB becoming a Very Big Deal.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://xmpp.org/">XMPP</a>.  Let&#8217;s first start with the bad things about it.  It&#8217;s complicated, overly abstract, obtuse, and there doesn&#8217;t seem to be a succinct definition of what it is.  You may disagree with any or all of those points, but one thing is clear: what it does well, it does better than anything else, and that is push communication.  Look for laconi.ca and twitter to be early leaders in this field, and for the technology to be simplified and clarified.  If you&#8217;re not subscribed to <a class="reference external" href="http://metajack.im/">Jack Moffitt</a>&#8217;s blog, do so.  Now.  He has pretty much single handedly rekindled my excitement for this technology, and with a few more people like him, we&#8217;ll see this technology execute on its vast potential.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://python.org/">Python</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://djangoproject.com/">Django</a>.  Of course I&#8217;m biased due to my closeness to these projects, and these are already big deals really.  But I think they will continue to further distinguish themselves from the competition.  Both projects have a reputation for not making important design decisions rashly and for sticking to their ideals.  As long as this trend continues, I believe the number of people flocking to these technologies will continue to grow.</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over the past few weeks I&#8217;ve been busy coding, planning, and recording a series of screencasts which walk through the complete process of building a web application, from the ground up, with Django.  First I actually needed to code the site, deploy the site, and release the source code for the site.  Then, I had to go back and decide what in that whole process was worth talking about.  Finally, I had to re-code the site, but this time in front of the camera.  It&#8217;s been a long process so far and I&#8217;m not finished yet, but tonight is the night that I am finally able to unveil the first two episodes.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t checked them out yet, head over to <a class="reference external" href="http://thisweekindjango.com/screencasts/episode/10/django-ground-episodes-1-and-2/">their spot on thisweekindjango.com</a>.</p>
<p>One thing that I&#8217;m a little bit worried about is that, by the very nature of going every step along the way, there are going to be some times where a topic I cover is on the more advanced side of things, and there are going to be topics that I cover which are on the more beginner side of things.  That can be fine, but there&#8217;s a risk that in targeting such a broad audience, nobody ends up enjoying it.  As long as at least one person gets something out of the screencasts, I&#8217;ll be happy.</p>
<p>So please, I only have 7 screencasts recorded so far, which means there is still time to turn this boat around!  If you have any suggestions or comments or questions, please leave a comment either here or on the <a class="reference external" href="http://thisweekindjango.com/screencasts/episode/10/django-ground-episodes-1-and-2/">episode&#8217;s page at thisweekindjango.com</a>.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The internet is such a strange place.  It allows us to collaborate on projects without ever seeing each other in person.  It allows us to meet new people, discover interests that we never knew we had, and keep in touch with friends.  However much the internet allows us to connect, though, there&#8217;s simply no replacement for face-to-face contact.  Who would have thought that a piece of software whose main goal is to ease the pain of creating websites could bring people together from Prague, London, Germany, and even Lawrence, Kansas?  To me, it&#8217;s nearly inconceivable.  But inconceivable or not, Django now has its <a class="reference external" href="http://djangocon.org/">very own conference</a>.</p>
<p>What I noticed about this first DjangoCon was a strange and exciting dichotomy of sorts, best exemplified by the opening and closing keynotes.  On the one hand, it&#8217;s difficult to believe just how far Django has come since it was first released in 2005.  On the other hand, there are so many great ideas for Django and Django-related projects that it&#8217;s nearly impossible to fight the urge to pop open your favorite text editor and start coding right now.</p>
<p>For <a class="reference external" href="http://avalonstar.com/">some people</a>, it was great to <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.howiworkdaily.com/">meet them</a> for the <a class="reference external" href="http://rob.cogit8.org/">first time</a>, and for <a class="reference external" href="http://jtauber.com/">others</a>, it was <a class="reference external" href="http://justinlilly.com/">great</a> to simply <a class="reference external" href="http://thisweekindjango.com/">reconnect</a>.  (Apologies to those that I couldn&#8217;t fit into those links, by the way.)  Below is what I find to be a hilarious image, courtesy of <a class="reference external" href="http://devdojo.de/stream/">Sebastian Hillig</a>&#8211;whose <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bastispicks/sets/72157607140512491/">Flickr page</a> has some really well-shot photos of the conference.</p>
<img alt="http://media.eflorenzano.com/img/djangocon.jpg" src="http://media.eflorenzano.com/img/djangocon.jpg" />
<p>For those of us involved in the <a class="reference external" href="http://pinaxproject.com/">Pinax</a> project, DjangoCon was a bit of a coming out party.  Firstly, in a literal sense&#8211;as <a class="reference external" href="http://cloud27.com/">cloud27</a>, the flagship website built on <a class="reference external" href="http://pinaxproject.com/">Pinax</a>, was launched (real men launch during presentations).  But also in a figurative sense&#8211;as most of us sported our Pinax-branded shirts and trumpeted the features that Pinax provides out of the box.  James Tauber&#8217;s talk that kicked it all off couldn&#8217;t have gone better, and I&#8217;m certain that when the video comes out on YouTube, it will enjoy a second and third life while people discover and become interested in the platform.</p>
<p>Another thing that surprised me about the conference was the amount of healthy criticism that went around in the conference.  Only a select few presentations escaped the <a class="reference external" href="http://flickr.com/photos/postneo/2836990032/">constructive criticism</a> of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.b-list.org/">James Bennett</a>, the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/704race/2835013556/in/set-72157607147999891/">wrath</a> of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.iamcal.com/">Cal Henderson</a>, or the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/704race/2837100896/">healthy reminders</a> by <a class="reference external" href="http://compoundthinking.com/blog/">Mark Ramm</a>.  Instead of people getting upset, though, I heard all sorts of conversations throughout the conference discussing ideas and strategies for how to overcome the shortcomings that were pointed out.</p>
<p>But in the end, what would DjangoCon be without a good old fashioned group hug?  Thanks to everyone who made it possible, and here&#8217;s to another year of friendship and achievement for everyone in Django-land!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday <a class="reference external" href="http://ulaluma.com/pyx/">Donovan Preston</a> released new versions of both <a class="reference external" href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/eventlet/0.7">eventlet</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Spawning/0.7">Spawning</a>.  What are those, you ask?  <a class="reference external" href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/eventlet/0.7">Eventlet</a> is a networking library written using coroutines instead of normal subroutes, which makes writing networked non-blocking IO applications much much simpler.  Spawning is a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wsgi.org/wsgi/">WSGI</a> server, written using <a class="reference external" href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/eventlet/0.7">eventlet</a>, which supports all of the things you&#8217;d expect of a good <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wsgi.org/wsgi/">WSGI</a> server: multiple processes, multiple threads, etc.</p>
<p>Considering that I sit next to Donovan at work all day, I&#8217;ve overheard him extolling the numerous advantages to using a server such as <a class="reference external" href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Spawning/0.7">Spawning</a>&#8211;the most obvious of which is completely graceful code reloading.  Donovan has given a presentation explaining how all of this works, the <a class="reference external" href="http://soundfarmer.com/content/slides/coroutines-nonblocking-io-eventlet-spawning/coros,%20nonblocking%20i:o,%20eventlet,%20spawning.pdf">slides of which</a> probably explain it better than I could.  When he told me that he&#8217;d added the ability to easily run Django apps with Spawning, I decided to check it out.</p>
<p>First, I installed spawning:</p>
<figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="line">sudo easy_install Spawning
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure><p>And away setuptools went and installed all of the prerequisites and the package itself.  (I have had problems with this in the past, but grabbing greenlet, eventlet, simplejson, PasteDeploy, and Spawning and installing them individually does the trick).</p>
<p>The next thing to do is go to the directory which holds your settings.py, or at least make setup.py available on the Python path.  I tend to find it easier to just go to the directory.  Then type the following:</p>
<figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="line">spawn --factory<span class="o">=</span>spawning.django_factory.config_factory settings --port 9090 -s 4 -t 100
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure><p>This starts up a Spawning server with 4 processes and 100 threads.  I chose those numbers almost completely arbitrarily.  (Well, that&#8217;s not entirely true, my Apache setup previously had 4 processes and 100 requests per child.  I know that requests per child doesn&#8217;t map at all to threads, but that&#8217;s where I got the number.)  The next thing to do is visit your site, but instead of visiting the normal port 80 or 8000, visit port 9090.  If you&#8217;re running it on your own box, that should be <a class="reference external" href="http://127.0.0.1:9090/">http://127.0.0.1:9090/</a>.</p>
<p>For me, it worked like a charm.  It felt like my server was responding faster than ever, but at that point it was just a feeling.  To get some quantitative analysis, I ran <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ApacheBench">apachebench</a> with 20 concurrent requests for a total of 10000 requests.  On my Apache + <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/">mod_wsgi</a> setup, I got <strong>235.65</strong> requests per second.  That was really good, I thought!  However, with the Spawning setup, I got <strong>347.20</strong> requests per second.  I would need to test this much more in-depth if I were a statistician, but it&#8217;s good enough for me as it did confirm my qualitative analysis.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re viewing this on my website directly, then you&#8217;ve already used Spawning, as I&#8217;ve switched over this blog to use the new server.  Let me know what you think!  Has my site slowed to a crawl?  Is it going faster than ever (because I know everyone remembers the speed at which eflorenzano.com loads)?</p>
<p>In all, it was an extremely easy upgrade.  I would recommend that everyone who has an interest in these types of things at least try it&#8211;especially if you&#8217;re looking into other pure-python WSGI servers like <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cherrypy.org/">CherryPy</a>.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: If you were having troubles reaching the site before, it&#8217;s because I was having problems with my database due to another app on the same server, not due to anything that Spawning was doing wrong.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class="section" id="journey-to-intermediary-models">
<h2>Journey to Intermediary Models</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s been around an 8 month journey in adding intermediary model support to Django, starting with <a class="reference external" href="http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/6095">a ticket</a> opened during a sprint by <a class="reference external" href="http://www.jacobian.org/">Jacob Kaplan-Moss</a>.  Earlier that month I had been wrestling with several pretty nasty models, each with two foreign keys and many extra properties on that relation.  I kept thinking that Django makes everything else so easy, but that in at least this one aspect, it doesn&#8217;t make things easy enough.  When Jacob posted his API idea, I was hooked.</p>
<p>I quickly posted some thoughts and asked for a bit of clarification, and volunteered to write the patch.  Jacob responded saying he was glad to help me out.  It was only then that I actually delved into the code to see how it could be done.  It was only then that I realized that I had absolutely no knowledge or familiarity with that portion of the codebase&#8211;a portion that is nontrivial, to say the least.  But that&#8217;s the good thing about committing to something: you feel pressure to follow through.</p>
<p>Despite my incredible NaA-vitA, the patch got to a rudimentary usable state very quickly, and then started to flounder.  It was then that <a class="reference external" href="http://djangopeople.net/freakboy3742/">Russell Keith-Magee</a> came into the picture, continually prodding me to add more tests, and thinking up many different test cases that I would have never come up with on my own.  I&#8217;m 100% certain that if Russ had not lent his expertise and guidance on this patch, it would have gotten lost and forgotten for a long time until someone more capable came along to take a look at it.</p>
<p>A few hours ago, Russ <a class="reference external" href="http://code.djangoproject.com/changeset/8136">committed the patch to trunk</a>.  It&#8217;s interesting to see the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.reddit.com/comments/6tzig/django_gets_intermediate_models/">reactions</a> that <a class="reference external" href="http://www.reddit.com/comments/6ty8n/extra_fields_on_m2m_relationships_has_landed_in/">some people have</a>, but on any project like this you&#8217;ll always be scrutinized.  In any case, check out the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/model-api/#extra-fields-on-many-to-many-relationships">two</a> new bits of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/admin/#working-with-many-to-many-intermediary-models">documentation</a>, and see if intermediary models are right for your project.  After having this great experience with working on a patch for Django, I&#8217;ll definitely be looking to help out in other places as well.  My advice for anyone looking to get involved with the project is to, well, get involved!  Jump in over your head.  It&#8217;s more fun that way.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pymag">
<h2>PyMag</h2>
<p>For around as long as I have been working on intermediary model support, I&#8217;ve been supporting another Django project of mine: <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/django-threadedcomments/">django-threadedcomments</a>.  One of the things that I noticed a few months into maintaining the project is that outside of a few people who were actively using it, not many people really knew about its existence.  So when <cite>Doug Hellmann</cite> (of the famously excellent <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.doughellmann.com/search/label/PyMOTW">PyMOTW</a> series) contacted me about writing an article for <a class="reference external" href="http://pymag.phparch.com/">PyMag</a>, it was immediately apparent what I would love to write about.  Over 4000 words later, between finals and school projects and moving across state boundaries, the article was written.</p>
<p>To be honest, I had almost completely forgotten about having written it, aside from one short e-mail conversation with the technical editor.  It turns out that the July 2008 edition of <a class="reference external" href="http://pymag.phparch.com/">PyMag</a> has arrived and my article is listed under &quot;featured articles&quot;.  How cool is that!?  I&#8217;m quite proud of the article, and really hope that it helps some people out with their Django websites.  If you aren&#8217;t a <a class="reference external" href="http://pymag.phparch.com/">PyMag</a> subscriber, then what are you waiting for?</p>
<p>This post seems to be doing a lot of self-promotion&#8211;sorry for that.  But these two things really made my day, and to me, blogging is about sharing those awesome days with others.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s always been a goal of mine to post screencasts here on my blog, but for whatever reason I never ended up getting around to it.  Today, that all changes as I have created two new screencasts.  Of course, this space is already very well-covered by both <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.michaeltrier.com/screencasts">Michael Trier</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://oebfare.com/blog/2008/jan/23/using-git-django-screencast/">Brian Rosner</a>, so hopefully this adds something new to the conversation.</p>
<div class="section" id="setting-up-a-django-development-environment">
<h2>Setting up a Django Development Environment</h2>
<p>In this screencast I show how I typically set up my Django development environment.  It goes through installing Django by checking out the latest development version and linking it to the correct places on your system.  It also talks about how to install reusable applications.  Finally, it covers how to update all of those projects and keep a toolbox of snippets for your personal use.</p>
<embed src="http://blip.tv/play/AcH7agA" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="720" height="510" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed><p>The simple pylink command that I use in the screencast is this:</p>

I highly recommend using this version instead of my one-liner.</p>

I&#8217;m loving this!  He has also written a &quot;pyunlink&quot; script, which can be found <a class="reference external" href="http://gist.github.com/21650">here</a>.</p>
<p>Please let me know in the comments if you have any other tips and tricks for setting up a development environment for Django.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="using-django-pagination">
<h2>Using Django-Pagination</h2>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/django-pagination/">Django-pagination</a> is an application that I wrote and released a while ago, which I use <em>all the time</em>, but that hasn&#8217;t really seen much attention.  In this screencast, I show how to take an existing project with too much data on one page, and use <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/django-pagination/">django-pagination</a> to quickly and easily paginate the items on the page.  There is a bit more documentation for the project that&#8217;s available in the project directory if you do a subversion checkout, and docstrings throughout the source code, if you&#8217;re interested in how it works.</p>

<div class="section" id="keep-in-mind">
<h2>Keep in Mind</h2>
<p>These are my very first screencasts, ever.  I&#8217;m not entirely sure what I&#8217;m doing yet, and the only way I can improve is by your feedback.  If you have any advice and/or criticisms of these screencasts, please don&#8217;t keep your mouth shut&#8211;speak up, and let me know in the comments.  Hopefully someone finds these useful, and thanks for watching!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class="section" id="japan-what-a-trip">
<h2>Japan: What a Trip</h2>
<p>There comes a time towards the end of most vacations where you&#8217;ve had a good time, but you&#8217;re ready to head back home and sleep in your own bed and see your friends.  No offense to any of my friends, but that time never came for me in Japan.  I completely fell in love with Tokyo, and didn&#8217;t want to come home.</p>
<p>I spent the vast majority of my time in Tokyo itself, but there was so much to do that there was never a dull moment.  Whether it was being completely and utterly lost in the red light district of Shinjuku, playing pachinko in Ueno, or people watching in Shibuya, I was always up to something.  Staying in hostels was probably the best choice that I could have made, because I met so many interesting and fun people!  Who else would I have done karaoke with, had it not been for the people I met at the hostel?</p>
<p>Spending a night in a capsule hotel was really interesting, too.  There&#8217;s way more space in there than you would think!  You can sit up, or just watch crazy people pretending to time travel on Japanese TV (the best parts are the advertisements, though).  And Japanese people are stylish!  Some of the styles are very over-the-top, and some are very conservative (never before have I seen so many suits and ties), but almost everyone is trying their hardest to go for style.</p>
<p>Good thing the German guys that I met had met Kazuya, or how would I have gotten in to that crazy hole-in-the-wall bar with only Japanese people and no tourists?</p>
<p>I could really go on endlessly about the trip, but needless to say, I&#8217;ll have the memories that will last forever.  If anyone is thinking of going to Japan, then stop thinking, just do it!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="san-francisco">
<h2>San Francisco</h2>
<p>As of the 4th of July, I&#8217;m a resident of the state of California.  I&#8217;ve got an awesome apartment on Bush street between Powell and Stockton&#8211;near Union Square where there are a lot of tourists.  It&#8217;s interesting because whenever I walk outside, I hear a whole variety of different languages and accents.  It&#8217;s really neat, although I suspect after a year its novelty will have worn off and then some.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also the first time that I&#8217;ve lived without any roommates.  To me, this is refreshing and fun.  It&#8217;s nice to get together with friends whenever I want, but also to be able to relax and avoid all possible forms of human interaction when I feel so inclined.  This is helped by the fact that I&#8217;m connected to the fastest internet connection that I&#8217;ve ever owned.</p>
<p>Also starting work at <a class="reference external" href="http://mochimedia.com/">Mochi Media</a> has been really good.  There&#8217;s a lot of new stuff to learn, though, so I&#8217;m not able to crank out as much code yet as I would like.  Their primary web development environment is <a class="reference external" href="http://pylonshq.com/">Pylons</a>, which has a decidedly different worldview than <a class="reference external" href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>.  I definitely think that there are good things and bad things from both sides, and hopefully the good things can eventually be shared.  I&#8217;ll  definitely revisit this once I&#8217;ve got more experience on the Pylons side.</p>
<p>Cheers to travelling around the globe, living independently, and learning new things!  Because in a nutshell, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been doing.</p>
<p>Up next: A series of screencasts.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a class="reference external" href="http://djangodash.com/">Djangodash</a>, a two-day two-person sprint to create a project using Django, took place last weekend.  To be honest, I wasn&#8217;t expecting it to be much fun, but it ended up being an absolute blast!</p>
<div class="section" id="feedalizer-net">
<h2><a class="reference external" href="http://feedalizer.net/">Feedalizer.net</a></h2>
<p>Before getting too far into this post mortem, I&#8217;m going to just get it out of the way and shamelessly promote the site that Tony and I created during the dash: <a class="reference external" href="http://feedalizer.net/">feedalizer.net</a>.  The idea behind the site is that it&#8217;s a feed aggregator, but people vote on the feeds.  The higher the feed&#8217;s score, the more likely items from that feed will bubble up to the top of the list.  There&#8217;s also the concept of a &quot;channel&quot;, which only aggregates feeds for a specific area.  For example, there&#8217;s a Humor channel, a Django channel, and a Python channel.  You can also subscribe to channels to create your own &quot;station&quot;, which aggregates the content from the channels that you care about.</p>
<p>The idea came to me when a friend of mine asked me <em>&quot;I&#8217;ve never used a feed reader before, but I want to get started and subscribe to programming feeds.  What are some good ones for me to subscribe to?&quot;</em>  It took me about 30 minutes to cull through my feeds and produce a list of the best.  But it shouldn&#8217;t have taken me any time at all&#8211;there should have been a site out there to do this for him!</p>
<p>OK, enough shameless self-promotion.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-dash">
<h2>The Dash</h2>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://djangodash.com/contest/team/">52 teams</a> registered for the dash, so watching the commit activity at the turn of the clock was pretty crazy.  Unfortunately, Tony was driving from 4 hours away and he hadn&#8217;t arrived yet.  When he did arrive, we both wanted to spend some time catching up and talking about non-Django things.  So we didn&#8217;t even get started until about 3:30AM.  Getting started mainly consisted of frantically checking in 3rd party projects that we thought we would use, and talking about architecture, and writing a few cron jobs.  Not much code got written that night (morning?), since we still had a lot of planning to do.</p>
<p>The next day, all of a sudden our commits weren&#8217;t working!  We went to the website to see what was going on, and the website wasn&#8217;t responding to our requests.  Something was definitely going on, and it was slowing down our progress significantly.  We tried working on our own separate parts of the project, but at this early stage there was simply too much overlap.  We found out later in the night that there were problems at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.webfaction.com/">Webfaction&#8217;s</a> data warehouse,`The Planet`_, where a transformer quite literally exploded.</p>
<p>This severely slowed us down, because we ended up having to switch to git, and then once we got everything into our git repository, we had tons of merge conflicts.  We got an e-mail saying that the due date would be postponed, so we decided to take the afternoon and night off to do other things.</p>
<p>The next day we did the brunt of our work.  I had the task of designing the frontend, so I opened up my trusty text editor and hammered out the worst-looking CSS file you&#8217;ll ever see in your life, producing some of the worst-looking pages you&#8217;ll ever see in your life.  This changed over the course of the day, but not by much as you&#8217;ll see if you visit the site.  This same day, Tony was working on some of the harder queries etc.</p>
<p>The final day (the deadline had been extended, remember) was all about integration.  There was nothing really notable about this, but it took all day to get everything working properly together.  I ended up writing a bunch of Javascript to make the client experience more enjoyable, and Tony had the chance to debug his views now that I had templates and we had sample data.  It was a crunch to make the deadline, but we tried to do the little important extra details like write an &quot;about&quot; page, a README file, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Whether we win or lose, and despite the technical difficulties that <a class="reference external" href="http://www.theplanet.com/">The Planet</a> suffered, I had a blast doing the competition.  I think that our idea is novel, and Tony and I got to work on something once more post-graduation.  (Nothing like a programming competition to bring people together, I always say.)  In fact, we&#8217;ll probably continue to work on it for the months to come, especially in upgrading its graphics.  It&#8217;s going to be really awesome to see what everyone else produced this year.  I encourage anyone who thought about participating this year, or anyone who even considers it as a possibility, to sign up and <strong>just do it</strong> next year!</p>
