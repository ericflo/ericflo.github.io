One of the justifications is that it will &quot;feel&quot; easier to plug in other template languages into Django itself.  Funny how <a class="reference external" href="http://www.eflorenzano.com/blog/cheetah-and-django/">I just blogged about how easy this is already</a>.</p>
<p>Also, previously this site was run with apache2 and perlbal.  Now it&#8217;s running apache2 and nginx.  At some point I&#8217;m going to make the switch to having all of the media pointing to an nginx-only server which short circuits the mod_python (also soon to be mod_wsgi, lol) handlers altogether.</p>
<p>Sorry that this is another in a line of short posts, but I expect this trend will continue as I move twice in the next 2 weeks.  Crazy stuff happening in my life right now!</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.sphinxsearch.com/">Sphinx Search ROCKS!</a>  I&#8217;m pretty sure it&#8217;ll be the solution to my MusicBrainz problems for my secret project.  I&#8217;m going to set up a simple postgres server holding the MusicBrainz database, with Sphinx Search installed, and have it index on a cron.  It&#8217;ll be awesome!  After trying out <a class="reference external" href="http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/">Lucene</a> and its derivatives and being so underwhelmed, it&#8217;s exciting to discover an app that truly seems to rock.  I&#8217;ll report back on it later, but right now the indexer is 4 million queries into a 60 million query index.  Yeah, it&#8217;s going to be a while.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been wanting to test drive two new technologies this past week, the first is <a class="reference external" href="http://bjorkoy.com/blueprint/index.html">Blueprint, the CSS Framework</a> which I saw on <a class="reference external" href="http://www.digg.com">Digg</a> a few days ago.  I also really wanted to try some new stuff with FreeComments, including saving people&#8217;s login information in the session.  I&#8217;m messing with both of those things in a side-side project related to <a class="reference external" href="http://revision3.com/trs">The Totally Rad Show</a> which I think promises to be really fun.  I&#8217;ve spent only a couple of hours on it, but I think it&#8217;s going to be probably my first project that people end up using.</p>
<p>So, <a class="reference external" href="http://revision3.com/trs/tuned">Stick Tuned</a> for a fun announcement from me in the next week or 2 weeks at the latest.  (The problem with this project is there&#8217;s lots of data to enter which will take time.)</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it for today, a short and sweet entry into this blog-o-rama.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Django is my preferred web development framework.  As such, I like it as a total solution: ORM, Template System, and Request/Response Mechanisms.  One of the criticisms that gets tossed around regarding Django is that it&#8217;s a monolithic web framework, and as such it is not loosely coupled.  I would argue that while it is a monolithic framework, it is still loosely coupled, and I&#8217;ll prove it by showing just how easy it is to replace the templating system.</p>
<p>After a quick google search for django and cheetah, I was surprised to find that there seem to be no really great examples online of the replacement of the template part of the Django stack.  That being the case, I have decided to provide some examples of how that can be accomplished.  In short, I&#8217;m going to demonstrate how to use the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cheetahtemplate.org/">Cheetah template language</a> with the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django web framework</a>.</p>
<p>Before we delve into how to integrate Cheetah with Django, first let&#8217;s look at some basic Cheetah syntax.  Basically all placeholders in cheetah templates are prefixed by $, and all control flow logic is prefaced by #.  Beyond that, mostly the syntax follows normal Python syntax.</p>
<p>If there&#8217;s a python object <tt class="docutils literal">test = [1, 2, &quot;3.1415&quot;, 4, range]</tt>, the Cheetah placeholder <tt class="docutils literal">$test[0]</tt> would return 1, <tt class="docutils literal">$test[2]</tt> would return 3.1415, and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">$test[4](0,$test[1])</span></tt> would return <tt class="docutils literal">[0, 1]</tt>.  To learn about control flow or any of the more advanced topics, you&#8217;ll have to visit <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cheetahtemplate.org/docs/users_guide_html/users_guide.html">the excellent Cheetah Users Guide</a>.</p>
<p>To demonstrate using Cheetah with Django, we&#8217;re going to use the canonical example: the blog.  First, the model (about the most simplistic one I could think of for a blog):</p>
<figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>

<span class="line-number">5</span>
<span class="line-number">6</span>
<span class="line-number">7</span>
<span class="line-number">8</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="python"><span class="line"><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">django.db</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">models</span>

</span><span class="line">        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">title</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure><p>Now, let&#8217;s make sure to add a template folder to TEMPLATE_DIRS in settings.py:</p>
<figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="python"><span class="line"><span class="n">TEMPLATE_DIRS</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span>

</span><span class="line"><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure><p>Now, one aspect of Django that I&#8217;ve gotten really accustomed to is the render_to_response method.  It&#8217;s nice to be able to specify a template name and pass in some context, and get an <tt class="docutils literal">HttpResponse</tt> object back.  So we&#8217;ll start by replacing that method, but for cheetah:</p>
<figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure><p>This code snippet can go anywhere, but to make it easy you can just put it in your <tt class="docutils literal">views.py</tt>.  As for how it works: basically we&#8217;re just iterating over each template directory in <tt class="docutils literal">TEMPLATE_DIRS</tt>.  If we find that a file exists, we create a cheetah Template object with that file as its base and with the specified context as its search list.  Then, we simply render the result into an <tt class="docutils literal">HttpResponse</tt> object.  I feel that this solution is both simple and robust&#8211;two concepts that usually exclude each other.</p>
<p>So, how would a simple view look using our new helper render_to_response?</p>
<figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure><p>Ok, it&#8217;s going to take a bit of explaining for that last snippet.  There&#8217;s a lot of advanced things going on that make it look totally unfamiliar.  But actually that&#8217;s just one big lie: this looks EXACTLY like any other Django view!  We&#8217;ve just completely and transparently replaced the templating system of Django, and all it took was a 7-line helper function.  But we&#8217;re not done yet.  We still have to write the template:</p>
<figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

</span><span class="line"><span class="nt">&lt;/html&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure><p>Now point a url to the example view, and watch the magic unfold.  I&#8217;m not a Cheetah user normally, so I can&#8217;t really comment about some of the more complex features of that language, but I can&#8217;t imagine that enabling them would be much more difficult than what we&#8217;ve already done here.  So, that means I&#8217;m totally aware that there may be some naivity in my implementation.  If so, please comment and I&#8217;ll change it accordingly.</p></div>

<h2>django-simpleaggregation</h2>
<p>I have just released Version 0.2 of <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/django-simpleaggregation/">django-simpleaggregation</a>.  Updates in this release:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The detection of an update on a unique field was not being correctly computed.  It used to use the addition of an id field to determine whether an aggregate should be incremented, but now it uses another hook into the dispatcher to annotate pre-save the model instance with some metadata related to aggregation.</li>
<li>The old helper functions which were used to get aggregate data have now been replaced with an object which is smarter and cleaner.  I suspect there will be a few more cleanup changes to the implementation of this, but the API should now stay fairly stable.</li>
<li>Pagination is now usable.  In 0.1, some rudimentary pagination abilities existed, but now it supports most of the same pagination data that a generic view gives a template.</li>

<h2>Eyespot</h2>
<p>My internship at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.eyespot.com/">eyespot</a> is coming to an end in a little over a week.  It&#8217;s really bittersweet for me:  it has been such a great experience, moving out to California and working on the &quot;Web too pwoint oahh&quot; craziness, but I miss my friends from the midwest.  I was a little nervous to take this internship, because of the technologies that I knew eyespot was using (notably, Perl), but my experience this summer only reinforces my original thought: programming language doesn&#8217;t matter, it&#8217;s people who matter.</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s people who matter, eyespot matters a whole lot, because there has been no other time when I have respected the people around me even close to as much as I respect those at eyespot.  I&#8217;ve never seen someone who can come up with the solution to a problem as I&#8217;m still trying to grasp the idea of the problem itself.  I&#8217;ve never seen people so willing to listen to and implement the ideas of an intern.  I&#8217;ve never seen a group of coworkers who were more welcoming and tight-knit, hanging out after work as much as during.  And most of all, I&#8217;ve never seen a group of people who were more skilled at their craft, as the people at eyespot.</p>
<p>Sure, there are some things that I think could be done better at eyespot.  Sometimes, frankly, I&#8217;m surprised that it all works.  But I&#8217;m not going to go into those things, however, because it&#8217;s actually not relevant to my point.</p>
<p>So, all said, I&#8217;m excited for what the future holds for me and eyespot, my working life after college, etc.  But to bring it back to my earlier point, I&#8217;m also excited for my last year in college.  Being away from home and family and friends has made me realize just how much I appreciate all of them on a daily basis, and perhaps just how much I take them for granted.  I could care less about going back to learn computer science&#8211;I&#8217;m going back for the people (is this a recurring theme, or what?)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to carpe diem this next school year, because it&#8217;s the last one I&#8217;ve got.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I don&#8217;t know how <a class="reference external" href="http://www.google.com/musica?aid=CthfGxkPMTB">Google</a> manages to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.google.com/musicl?lid=1SpDWykV7NL&amp;aid=CthfGxkPMTB">do it</a>!  They&#8217;ve linked music track/artist/album to online music vendors, a deceivingly simple-sounding task which has been the bane of my existence for the last two weeks.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with two of the big players:</p>
<div class="section" id="itunes">
<h2>iTunes</h2>
<p>iTunes has a terrible API: You go to <a class="reference external" href="http://ax.phobos.apple.com.edgesuite.net/WebObjects/MZStoreServices.woa/wa/itmsLinkMaker">iTunes Link Maker</a> and type in the keywords of your choice.  You can come up with a programmatic way to access this but it involves parsing invalid HTML.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="amazon">
<h2>Amazon</h2>
<p>Amazon&#8217;s API is a good programmatic interface to its own internal service, but unfortunately that service is TERRIBLE.  Take <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Rodrigo-y-Gabriela-Bonus-DVD/dp/B000HKDEE2/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-5025068-6051344?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1185941115&amp;sr=8-1">this</a>, for example: a CD from a wonderful band called Rodrigo y Gabriela.  One of the songs on it is named &quot;Ixtapa&quot;, so let&#8217;s do a search for &quot;Ixtapa Rodrigo y Gabriela.&quot;  Makes sense, right?  Apparently not to Amazon&#8217;s search.  In fact, amazon&#8217;s search really has no concept of the song.  It&#8217;s not something that they sell. Amazon knows all about album titles and artists, but not about the song itself.  This renders it useless for linking song to vendor!</p>
<p>But what about open source?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="musicbrainz">
<h2>MusicBrainz</h2>
<p>So the next thing that I try is using <a class="reference external" href="http://musicbrainz.org/">MusicBrainz</a>, an open source database of music metadata, which seems to have Amazon.com linking information built right in.  However, reading through the wiki, for hours, and hours, and hours, is not fun.  They have bits and pieces from all different times of the project&#8217;s lifecycle, most of which is irrelevant.  But after a while I find out that to get access to the web services, you either need to limit your requests to 1 per second (unacceptable in my case), or you have to set up your own MusicBrainz server.  OK, let&#8217;s do that!</p>
<p>Oh wait, they forgot to mention that it&#8217;s the most rediculous dependency-ridden piece of bloatware ever.  It&#8217;s so bad that they don&#8217;t even really have a guide on how to set it up&#8211;they&#8217;ve given up and just created a virtual machine for people to download.  OK, well fine, let&#8217;s download that and go from there.  What&#8217;s this?  There&#8217;s more setup?  Apparently so, because I had to leave my computer to import data and compute indexes for 3 days straight.</p>
<p>Finally, finally, I am ready to start accessing that music -&gt; amazon.com data, when I notice something: Non-Commercial license.  After all of this, the AMAZON SPECIFIC PORTION ONLY is licensed differently, and I cannot use it.  I am disappointed with this service, to say the least.  MusicBrainz needs a major overhaul in its software dependencies (Hint: Use Python, it&#8217;s got batteries included.)  It also needs to take a serious look at its licensing scheme.  If it can address these two things, it will be much further along in its goal to make a great community database.</p>
<p>Information has a long way to go.  Music metadata and the ability to link to different music vendors should be ubiquitous and available in a standard way.  Nobody is benefiting by putting a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gracenote.com/">lock and key</a> on this sort of data.  The people who really lose, in the end, is the music vendors who get ultimately less sales.  Hopefully someday soon they see the light, and fight to make this information accessible.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It was only a matter of time before the iPhone private SDK was cracked, and it looks as if that matter of time is <a class="reference external" href="http://iphone.fiveforty.net/wiki/index.php/UIKit_Hello_World">Up</a>.  This news is exciting to me as an iPhone user, but also as a programmer.  Assuming Apple doesn&#8217;t patch this, which is a fairly large assumption, the UIKit will just continue to get more and more community documentation, and get easier and easier to work with.  There are so many little apps that I want to see, (&#8230;for example, a voice record app!) that no bad can come out of this development.</p>
<p>About django_simpleaggregation:  Well, one person responded on the mailing list, but that&#8217;s it.  I guess I hoped to get more of a response, given all of the work that went into the documentation and tutorial for it.  In hindsight, I should have posted it to both the django-users and the django-developers mailing lists, instead of just the one for developers.  But that&#8217;s not really an option either, as you look like a jerk for crossposting.  In any case, I&#8217;m sure people will stumble upon it and find it useful.</p>
<p>Google analytics rocks, by the way.  I installed it for this site just a few days ago and am amazed by how polished and easy to use it is for a free site.  It would be nice to get more frequent updates on the metrics, but hey, it&#8217;s free!  Not only is it good for figuring out where your traffic is coming from (mine is coming from Europe, mostly), but its good for finding out what people are looking at.  In my case, embarrassingly enough,  people are looking at that old unfinished django gallery app tutorial.</p>
<p>Besides all of this geeky stuff that this blog is usually about, I&#8217;ve recently started watching the BBC-produced TV show Jekyll.  It sounds like a terrible idea for a series, and maybe it is, but it&#8217;s got me hooked.  There&#8217;s something intrinsically great about a story where one is constantly learning/discovering.</p>
<p>Think about the first time you saw the first Matrix movie, and they started explaining what the Matrix was, or in Memento when you finally started getting the necessary information to piece everything together, or even in The Usual Suspects, when you find out about Kaiser Sose.  It&#8217;s the same thing with every episode of Jekyll.  The first episode, you know just a tiny sliver of information about the overall story, and as they reveal more information, what you automatically assumed ended up being wrong.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have just released version 0.1 of a spinoff project I did today.  I&#8217;ve been working on a side project which I&#8217;m not ready to talk about yet, and one of the things that I have consistently  needed was simple aggregation on Django models.  Nothing complicated like what we&#8217;ll start to see with the new aggregation framework, but just simple things like counts on objects based on the uniqueness of certain fields of a model.</p>
<p>So check that out: <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/django-simpleaggregation/">Here</a>  I&#8217;d really appreciate any feedback or comments you can give me.</p>
<p>So, that actually took quite a bit of time an energy to write, document, create a google project, package and upload, etc.  More time than I would have liked, but if it helps even one person, then it&#8217;s worth it.</p>
<p>In other news, I have tried out <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/">mod_wsgi</a> for Python and hosting my Django stuff, and WOW I must say that I&#8217;m quite impressed.  I haven&#8217;t done any formal testing on it like <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/wiki/PerformanceEstimates">Graham Dumpleton, the creator, has done</a>, but from my own informal observations I&#8217;ve noticed a good bump up in the snappiness of the app that I&#8217;m working on.</p></div>
